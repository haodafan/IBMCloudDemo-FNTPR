# SO YOU WANT TO BE A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER ON THE IBM CLOUD AS A COOP INTERN WORKING FOR THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND LONG TERM CARE

**By: Haoda Fan (Software developer on a Cloud Platform, Co-op student from the University of Waterloo)**

**December, 2017**

# 1.0 INTRODUCTION
**Obligatory introductory hook:**

*Welcome to the machine. You are a small cog in the enormous all-encompassing engine that is the Ontario Government. To survive, you cannot simply follow the mindless herd. You must rise above the herd, define your own identity and values, and become your own individual. Be the Ubermensch. Code the software you wish to see in the world, using the sheer power of your will.*

*- I think Nietzsche said something like this before probably or maybe I just made it up*

---

**What is the purpose of this document?**

As a past co-op student, I have experienced a set of **issues and difficulties** that have gotten in the way of my productivity on the cloud, with no real training or mentoring to help me along (although this could change in the future, because as of the writing of this document, the cloud is a very new thing for our department). In order for you to not be stuck on all the things I was stuck on, I have been voluntold to document all the difficulties I had and the things that I have learned while creating my main project, the First Nations' Digital Income Reporting program.

Anyways, on to cloud development and (hopefully) making your life easier.

(Note: I am NOT a technical writer. If anything here confuses you, please feel free to contact me and ask me anything, I have all my contact information at the end of the document.)

# 2.0 PROBLEMS YOU WILL ENCOUNTER AND HOW TO SOLVE ... MOST OF THEM

*We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do other things* (like develop on the Cloud)*, not because they are easy, but because they are hard!*

*- John F. Kennedy*

## 2.1 Administrative Privileges
**Problem**

As a software development intern, you do not have access to administrative privileges on your computer! This means you will not be able to **INSTALL** any programs, or **CHANGE** any sensitive data or settings on your computer. Of course, you can still download files from the internet, but when you have to install a new language, or change a PATH variable, then you will not have permission to do so.

**Solution**

To solve this problem, you will need to **enlist the help of your manager**. If the heavens smile upon you this co-op term, then the ministry might be able to get you administrative privileges to your own computer upon your request; however, that is unlikely to happen, and it did not happen to me<sup>[1]</sup>. More likely, after a lengthy request process, your manager will most likely have to **give admin access to your computer to a trusted coworker**.

After he/she gains access to your computer, **every time you need administrative priviledges, you will have to ask him/her to login and install or change things for you**. It's a bit annoying and inefficient for everyone involved, so its best to first **create a list of all the things you know you need an admin to install for you**, and get them all ready before your coworker buddy comes to install it for you. That way, you can **get many installations done in one fell swoop**, rather than have him/her come over a dozen times to install one thing every single time.

[1] Sidenote: apparently in the past, software development interns were granted administrative access to their computers, but this priviledge was recently removed for security reasons (I think there was some virus going around?). Anyway, thanks a lot that one intern who probably downloaded a virus, I blame this on you.

## 2.2 The OPS Firewall
**Problem**

The OPS firewall is probably the single most annoying obstacle I encountered in my first few weeks of work. The OPS firewall **forbids you from accessing certain websites** (such as **YouTube**), and **denies you the freedom to download and access** the web from the **command line** or through **third party applications** that aren't browsers (such as **Maven** and **JMeter**).

The Ontario Public Service's Great Firewall restricts you to such an extent, that it makes even Fang BinXing jealous<sup>[citation needed]</sup> , and as cloud developers, asking us to work with this firewall is akin to asking a surgeon to perform surgery with his bare hands and blindfolded.

**Solution**

Luckily, us Cloud Developers are much more cunning than the average government grunt. Throughout my ~~reign~~ time here, I have been able to figure out how to bypass this firewall through the clever use of a **proxy**.

### 2.2.1 Setting up a proxy for Apache Maven

If you're programming in Java EE on Eclipse, you may need to use Maven. Unfortunately, if you try to build with Maven without a proxy, Maven will simply return an error when it tries to access and download its resources.

To solve this, go into your .m2 folder (it should be in your user folder), create a new file called 'settings.xml'.

Then, enter the following code:

```xml
<settings>
	<proxies>
	<proxy>
		<id>myproxy</id>
		<active>true</active>
		<protocol>http</protocol>
		<host>204.40.130.129</host>
		<port>3128</port>
		<username></username>
		<password></password>
		<nonProxyHosts>localhost,127.0.0.1</nonProxyHosts>
	</proxy>
	<proxy>
		<id>myhttpsproxy</id>
		<active>true</active>
		<protocol>https</protocol>
		<host>204.40.130.129</host>
		<port>3128</port>
		<nonProxyHosts>localhost,127.0.0.1</nonProxyHosts>
	</proxy>
	</proxies>
</settings>
```

**Note:** If you already have a settings.xml, then simply add the contents inside the <settings></settings> tags.

### 2.2.2 Setting up a proxy for JMeter

If you want to use JMeter to load test a certain web application, you'll need get it over OPS's firewall first, or else it will simply return data essentially saying that the website gave them no response (which makes sense, since JMeter's request wouldn't make it through in the first place).

To accomplish this is very simple. You'll simply need to run JMeter through the **command line** every time you use it, with certain settings. Here is a step-by-step process...

1. Navigate to the folder where JMeter is located.
2. Shift + Right Click on the 'bin' folder
3. Click 'Open command window here'. It should open up command prompt at that location.
4. Enter the following command:
``` jmeter.bat -H 204.40.130.129 -P 3128 -N localhost,127.0.0.1 -u -a ```

With that, JMeter should be running through a proxy server and able to load test any website you desire!


### 2.2.3 Setting up a proxy for Bluemix CLI

If you're building a Node.JS application on IBM Cloud (aka IBM Bluemix), then you'll likely want to do so locally (like in the tutorials). To do so, you'll need to install the Command Line Interface.

First, ask your administratively talented coworker (or whoever has admin rights to your computer) to log in and install it for you. That should ensure it installs properly, and the commands are added to your PATH environment variables.

Unfortunately, for the CLI to connect to IBM's Cloud, you'll need to get past the gates of ~~Mordor~~ OPS's firewall. Here are more of my step by step instructions. I make learning FUN.

1. Go to your control panel, and look up 'Environment Variables'.
2. Click on 'Edit environment variables for your account'.
3. Under user variables for {whoever you are}, click the 'New...' button.
4. In variable name, enter 'HTTP_PROXY'
5. In variable value, enter '204.40.130.129:3128'
6. Repeats step 3-5, except have the variable be named 'HTTPS_PROXY'
7. With those two new variables added in, click 'OK'.

Now, you should be able to run the Bluemix CLI without any dehabilitating firewall issues.

### 2.2.4 Setting up a proxy for Node and NPM

If you want to get in on the newest ~~fads~~ ~~trends~~ ~~bandwagons~~ technologies in the web development world, you'll need to use Node.JS, and its equally important partner, Node Package Manager (npm).

Unfortunately, it uses a command line interface, and like everything else with command lines, the firewall hates it with a passion. Once again, let's set a **proxy**. Open up the command line, and type the following two commands:

`npm config set proxy http://204.40.130.129:3128`

`npm config set https-proxy https://204.40.130.129:3128`

With these set up, you should be able to run npm commands liberally.

### 2.2.5 Setting up a proxy for Git

In order to use the git command line interface (very useful if you use github or any kind of git-related version control system), you'll need to set a proxy in a very similar fashion to the proxy set for node and npm. Simply enter the following commands:

`git config --global http.proxy http://204.40.130.129:3128`

`git config --global https.proxy https://204.40.130.129:3128`

Now clone and push and pull and merge at will! You're free I say! Free!

### 2.2.6 Setting up a proxy for ... basically anything else

At this point you should kind of get the idea. If whatever thing you're using is being blocked by the OPS firewall, simply look up how to set a proxy for that thing, and use the following information:

* **Host/URL/Whatever (works for both http and https)**: 204.40.130.129
* **Port**: 3128
* (No username, no password)

All the information above was a result of me looking up how to setup proxies for those specific applications and entering that data. I hope the five above sections will save you the trouble of doing it yourself for those in particular.



Anyway, are those cows I see, grazing in the distance? Looks like it's time to MOO-ve on ahaha ... (sorry)

## 2.3 Node Package Manager Problems
**Problem**
If you use Node.js, or any advanced Javascript framework, then you will definitely want to use Node Package Manager, or npm. After installing node and setting up a proxy for npm (Refer to section 2.2.4), most npm packages can be installed without problem using the command line. **Most**. Unfortunately, there are some that won't work, namingly '--global' packages and some packages required to run angular and react.

I figured the problem must lie with my (lack of) administrative privileges, so I asked my coworker to run the command line as admin, so that I could install them with the correct privileges. Unfortunately, that didn't work, because (and this is just speculation, I'm still not sure exactly why it didn't work) logging into his administrative account must have mixed up the command line's installation addresses.

**Solution (or more accurately, workaround) for non global packages**

Unfortunately, I could not find a way to properly get direct command line installations to work for all node packages. Instead, I used a little workaround.

Although your node package manager is not permitted to install everything you want it to at work, **that does not mean you can't do it from home**. Although it seems kinda dumb, inefficient, and a bit of a 'duct tape' solution, in the end, it worked, and that's all that matters... right?

Here is the step by step process.
1. Write down the package names you need to install.
2. Go home (When your work ends, obviously).
3. Open up node on your personal computer (install it if you don't have it).
5. Create a new node project using 'npm init'.
6. Use 'npm install --save' to install all the necessary components.
7. Take your node_modules folder and your package.json folder, and compress it into a zip or similar
8. Upload the file to Google Docs, or email it to yourself.
9. Go to work (the next day, obviously).
10. Download and unzip your files, and then paste the contents of node_modules into your project folder
11. Open package.json from your downloaded file and copy the "dependencies"
12. Add (paste) the dependencies from your downloaded package.json to your project's package.json
13. Voila! You now have all your necessary node libraries.

**Similar solution (or more accurately, workaround) for global packages**

Similarily and also unfortunately, I also could not find a way to make this work directly on the work computers as well. The only way I knew to get around this, is that whenever you want to use a global command, to transfer the necessary files to your home computer, install/use the global command from home, and then transfer it back to the work computers. This is highly inefficient, so I either avoid global commands whenever possible, or I bring my home computer (which happens to be a laptop) to work, and use my computer with the wifi downstairs when I needed to. Not exactly an elegant solution, but it worked for me.

__**If you come up with a better solution, then by all means, go ahead and use that. This is just what I have learned worked best for me at the time (with the information I possessed).**__

## 2.4 Debugging on the Cloud

**Problem**

As someone who has never really done work with backend programming before this job, the thing I initially found most frustrating about work on the cloud is debugging. Whenever a portion of my program fails while testing with my browser, it would give me a

`Error 500: Internal Server Error`.

Okay... not very helpful, let me just ctrl+shift+I ...

```Error 500 Internal Server Error```

What the ... ?? How am I supposed to know what's wrong if this is all the info you give me??? ARGHHHGHHH

I know. I'll just write some console.logs to tell me which parts work and which parts don't. Now, when I go into the browser console, I see...

```Error 500 Internal Server Error```

WHAT??? (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

**Solution**

So... how do you debug on the cloud?

 ┬─━┬﻿ ノ( ゜-゜ノ)

Turns out, when running any back-end server application, the app will not print its logs or statuses (or anything useful) in the browser console. The **browser console** only deals with **client side code**. **Server side logs** are handled by the back-end server console, which in this case, is your **IBM Cloud server**.

You have two ways of retrieving the logs. The first way, the one that I don't like, is through IBM Cloud's web UI, where you can view your logs from there. Simply click on your program from your dashboard, and go to the 'Logs' tab.

In my opinion, IBM's browser-based UI is very slow and the retrieved logs are both hard to read and slow to load.

**The better way** (in my opinion), is to use the following command locally:

`cf logs --recent applicationName`

with applicationName being whatever name you gave to your application (in the case of my program, it was demo-fntpr-2). To retrieve logs, I prefer using git bash instead of command prompt, because the font is both smaller and easier to read.

## 2.5 UNSOLVED ISSUES

### 2.5.1 Building some applications on Java EE 

Note that some applications require more than just Apache Maven to build it (namingly, the [dayTrader7](https://github.com/WASdev/sample.daytrader7) program I was asked to port to the cloud. Even after setting up the proxy for Apache Maven, it still returned connection-related errors for me whenever I tried building it. I eventually gave up on this, as I could not find what exactly was causing the problem and how to fix it.

Maybe you could figure this one out? 

### 2.5.2 'Proxy Authentication Required'

Even after setting a proxy, every so often, you are once again prevented from accessing the internet via command line because of an error that prompts you to authenticate yourself ("Proxy Authentication Required."). To this day, I still have no idea what causes it. I do know that it usually happens early in the morning (~9AM), at noon, and about an hour or so before I'm supposed to leave (~4pm).

The problem usually goes away after simply waiting 5-10 minutes, although sometimes, this 'authentication required' block can last up to an hour. It's really not good for productivity, but I honestly have no clue what causes it and how to fix it, so I normally just wait it out.

# 3.0 MY CLOUD PROJECT AND HOW TO RUN IT / USE THE CLOUD

*JUST DO IT!*

*- Shia Laboeuf*

---

I spent around a month developing this project, meant to be a proof-of-concept prototype application for the IBM Cloud. You can find its github [here](http://github.com/haodafan/IBMCloudDemo-FNTPR). The github shows the ReadMe.MD file, which contains some basic information about my project.

Here, I'll show you how to run and edit it.

## 3.1 Before starting...

Make sure you have the following installed: 
- [NodeJS (version 8 or higher)](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
- [Bluemix Command Line Interface](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cli/index.html#downloads)

Remember to enlist the help of your administratively-talented coworker/manager, and to set up a proxy (Refer to Section 2)

## 3.2 Downloading my project

To download the source files for my project, simply open command prompt in the folder you want to put it in (remember, you can shift right click the folder, and select 'open command prompt here'), and type the command:

`git clone https://github.com/haodafan/IBMCloudDemo-FNTPR.git`

After you cloned the source files, you'll have to download the **dependencies**. For the sake of conserving space, I have omitted the dependencies in my git repository, but you can easily download them by running the node command: 

`npm install` 

(if you're doing this at work, make sure to have the proxy setup! See 2.2.4 and 2.2.5)

With those two simple commands, you should have all the source files necessary for my project. 

## 3.3 Setting up the app locally and connecting it to the Cloud

### 3.3.1 Method 1: Using Nenad's Account

My current version of the project is already on Nenad Jelic's IBM Cloud account.

To push any changes you make onto this version, you must first contact him and ask for his account information (in a not sketchy way). His email is Nenad.Jelic@ontario.ca , but you can also ask your manager Sam to contact him for you.

After knowing his username and password,

1. Shift right click the folder 'IBMCloudDemo-FNTPR', which contains the source files for my program, and click the option to open command prompt there.
2. Enter the command: `cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net`
3. Enter the command: `cf login`
4. Enter the username, press enter, enter the password, press enter

### 3.3.2 Method 2: Using your own Account

If you have your own IBM Cloud account and would like to use that, it's a little harder to do. This is because I already have the necessary database service set up on Nenad's account.

In order to make my program work, you need to set up your own ClearDB database.

First, follow the instructions on Section 4.2 to create your own ClearDB database.

**NOTE:** If you didn't name your database 'ClearDB_LindaTest', you'll have to go into the file 'manifest.yml', and in the 'services' section, change that to match your database name.

Then, you must create the database table structure identical to that of mine. I suggest getting the help of my coworker Linda Yang, as she is the one who created much of my database initially, and is probably the most knowledgeable on what the structure is. Here is a visual diagram of my database's structure.

![visual diagram that I hope will help](/diagram2.png)

Once you did both these things, you are ready to set it up on the cloud! It is done in the exact same way as Method 1, except with your own account credentials instead of Nenad's.

## 3.4 How to Push Changes onto the Cloud

Pushing your changes onto the cloud is easier than dominating the midlane as Tinker.

Simply open up your command prompt at the source folder (like before), enter the command `cf push`.

It should take about a minute for IBM Cloud to build and deploy your project for you.

**NOTE ON HOW I DEBUG:**
1. Make a change in my code
2. enter `cf push` in command line
3. Open git bash (like I said in 2.4, the git bash font is smaller and more readable)
4. enter `cf logs --recent demo-fntpr-2` in git bash (you don't need to open it at any specific location)
5. Read the log and see what I did right/wrong
6. Repeat

# 4.0 HOW I DEVELOPED MY CLOUD PROJECT

*If builders built buildings the way programmers wrote programs, then the first woodpecker that came along would destroy civilization.*

*-Gerald Weinberg*

---

My project has several components, which can be considered mini-projects. Since I don't trust myself to be able to code in an easily readable and understandable format, I will do my best to go through and explain my development process for each part of those components.

## 4.1 Starting a Node.JS project on Bluemix


I started off my project with [this simple tutorial](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/runtimes/nodejs/getting-started.html).

This tutorial essentially taught me how to setup my development environment, and push a sample application onto Bluemix.

### 4.1.1 manifest.yml
The manifest.yml file contains the metadata for your project (like your project name, your project URL, the services that are used, etc). This file is important, as it tells the IBM Cloud how to run your project.

## 4.2 Using ClearDB (MySQL) with your Node application and the Cloud.

The sample application uses Cloudant, which is a NoSQL database. Now, even though NoSQL databases like Cloudant and MongoDB are currently all the rage, the government and many large corporations prefer to use good old SQL. So, I'll give you a lil lesson on how to use ClearDB, a free MySQL database service, for your Node application.

1. To create a ClearDB service for IBM Bluemix, simply go to the Catalog, and scroll down to the 'Data Analytics' section to find 'ClearDB for MySQL' (make sure you're logged into your account and in the 'console.bluemix.net' part of IBM's website. Since it's a third-party application, it only shows up there).
2. Give your service a name (Mine was named 'ClearDB_LindaTest').
3. Click on the first pricing plan, which is free (CB5)

Now, the ClearDB database service has been crated and the required resources allocated to your IBM Cloud account. Now... how do you use it?

4. Open up your manifest.yml file (use Notepad++, Atom.io, or any similar kind of text editor. Even normal old notepad works. Don't use MS Word though. You can do it online too)
5. In your file, add the following code to the end (If there's already a 'services' with things in it, just add the second line to it):

```
services:
	- ClearDB_LindaTest
```

(Note: if you set a different name for your service, replace 'ClearDB_LindaTest' with the name of your service)

Now, through the all-important manifest.yml file, you will have linked your database service with this application.

So, how does one use ClearDB in the program itself?

ClearDB is a MySQL database. I largely based my code on [this IBM demo](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/compose-mysql-helloworld-nodejs), where I learned how to set up and use mysql with node. The main difference between that program and this one, is that the demo uses Compose-for-MySQL instead of ClearDB. The only real difference between the two though, is the name of the service (Mine is 'cleardb' instead of 'compose-for-mysql').

Here are the basics:

### 4.2.1 Basic setup

First, you will need node's mysql package, so run `npm install --save mysql` from the command line in your project folder (Databases sometimes don't work thanks to the firewwall, if that happens, you can use my chapter 2.3 method to get around that).

To be able to connnect to and access your database, you'll need to use the following setup:

```javascript
// Code required for IBM Bluemix to function
var cfenv = require('cfenv');
var appEnv = cfenv.getAppEnv();


//Imports the MySQL module for you to use
var mysql = require('mysql');


var services = appEnv.services; //Gets the services list from IBM Bluemix
var mysql_services = services["cleardb"]; //Gets the specifications for the clearDB service
var credentials = mysql_services[0].credentials; //Gets the CREDENTIALS for the database.
//Credentials contain the authentication information that allows you to connect to the database.

var connectionString = credentials.uri; // The authentication information in URI string format

```

Now that you've obtained the necessary tools to connect to the database, we can proceed with ... actually connecting to the database.

**NOTE:** In my program, I made a separate module 'database.js' in the config folder that exports the connection string, so that in my app.js program, I need only write:

```javascript
var dbConfig = require('./config/database'); //Where dbConfig = connectionString
```

### 4.2.2 Connect vs ConnectionPool

In my **ORIGINAL** code (based on the tutorials), to establish a connection to the database, I used:

```javascript
var dbConfig = require('./config/database');

var connection = mysql.createConnection(dbConfig); //A connection is established using the credentials

connection.connect(function(err) {
	if (err) {
		console.log("Could not establish connection!");
		console.log(err)
	}
	else {
		// Querying ...
	}
});
```

This worked for most simple practice programs I did before working on this particular project, but I soon ran into some problems.

When coding for this project and testing it out on Bluemix, I often (and seemingly randomly) ran into this error:

`Error: Server has closed the connection. `

The apparent cause, is that when a connection is idle for a long time, MySQL automatically closes it. The solution that I implemented, is to use a connection POOL instead of a single connection.

After years of searching far and wide all around the world, I finally came across the answer in a buddhist temple in the mountains of Nepal<sup>[Citation needed]</sup>, in the form of a Stack Overflow answer. Apparently, instead of using a single connection, I need to make a **POOL** of connections for my server, and make sure to release the connection after I finish using it.

My **new code** looked like this:
```javascript
var dbConfig = require('./config/database');

var connectionPool = mysql.createPool(dbConfig);

connectionPool.getConnection(function(err, connection) {
	if (err) {
		console.log(err);
	}
	else {
		//Querying ...
		connection.release();
	}
})

```

Which fixed the error for me.

With this, you should be able to query at will to the database!

### 3.2.3 How to Query in your Node program

Querying is simple with the mysql API, and there are many online tutorials on how to do so.

Here is the super duper condensed version:
```javascript
//Assuming the you named the same variable 'connection' as the previous code examples have
connection.query(anyQueryString, function(error, dataReturnedByQuery) {
	//Code here is executed after you query
	console.log(dataReturnedByQuery); //That variable is anything returned by MySQL as a result of your query
});
```

Look, it's so condensed, I can already see the water droplets forming around it (haha get it? I'm sorry).

### 4.2.4 Editing and Viewing the database with ClearDB and MySQL

Most of the database used in this program was made by my awesome coworker, Linda Yang. She used a MySQL workbench type application, established a remote connection to the database, and created the tables from there. Unfortunately, due to our poor status as ~~peasants~~ interns, we don't actually have access to these SQL tools (As far as I know, at least). Also, to my knowledge, there's no way to query to the ClearDB from the IBM Cloud or from ClearDB's interface itself, so we're going to have to be a bit more clever.

It seems like the **only way we can query this database, is through our application and node.js server**, so what I did, is **make a webpage whose sole function is to make any query to any part of the database**. The application itself is routed from ('/make-query'), and the page contains only a text area to put your query in, a button to submit it, and a section that displays the query result.

![What it looks like](/make-query.PNG)

The application logic is very simple. The submit button makes a POST request with the inputted text, and I simply use my newQuery function (which just makes a query) with whatever input it received, and displays the result in that section.

Whenever I needed to create a new table, add/remove/edit a column, delete rows, or do anything relating to the database, I would go to that webpage and make the query from there.

Not the most elegant solution, but one that worked for me nonetheless.

To make things easier for myself, I added a few more functions to my application, accessible through the URL, including a function that displays all the data in the table ('/test'), a function that deletes all rows from the user table ('/delete-all-data-from-table-user'), and one that deletes all from the funding table ('/delete-all-data-from-table-funding').

---

**NOTE:** Whenever you want to log the data from your database, do NOT log it as a string. Remember that it is an OBJECT, so you must log it as such:
```javascript
connection.query("SELECT * FROM table", function(err, data) {
	//This code WILL NOT work
	console.log("Data: " + data);

	//This code WILL work
	console.log("Data: ");
	console.log(data)
})
```

**SIMILAR NOTE:** Whenever you want to output objects from the database as strings or html, you can't do it directly either.

```javascript
connection.query("SELECT * FROM table", function(err, data) {
	var outputThis = data; //This is NOT a string. This is an OBJECT

	var outputThis1 = JSON.stringify(data) //This is a STRING. You can output this.
	var outputThisThingInParticular = data.name //Assuming name is a string column, this is a STRING, and you can output it.
})
```

You may think this is obvious. And you might be right. But I know I was stuck trying to figure out why my program wouldn't output anything for a LONG time, and turns out, there was nothing wrong with my database or querying or anything, I was just trying to output an object as if it was a string. So hopefully this saves you a lot of trouble, in case you are as dumb as I am.

## 4.3 User Authentication using Passport
For user authentication with Passport, a Node library, I largely based my code on [this tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/easy-node-authentication-setup-and-local)

However, there are a few important differences between my code and the code from the tutorial. First of all, the tutorial uses MongoDB and Mongoose as their databases. Here in the Ontario Ministry of Health, nobody uses NoSQL databases, we use MS SQL Server, Oracle (SQL), and other relational databases. So, as mentioned before, I used the ClearDB MySQL database instead.

So each time in the tutorial, when they would use any sort of mongoose database-related code like:

```javascript
// find a user whose email is the same as the forms email
// we are checking to see if the user trying to login already exists
User.findOne({ 'local.email' : email }, function(err, user) {
 //...
});
```

I would replace it with ...

```javascript
// Use a query to find a user whose email is the same as the forms email
query.newQuery("SELECT Email FROM user u WHERE u.Email LIKE '" + email + "';", function(error, user) {
	// Code here executes after you query ...
});
```

**NOTE:** I later changed it again to what it is now ...

```javascript
// Use a query to find a user whose email is the same as the forms email
query.newQuery("SELECT UserName FROM user u WHERE u.UserName LIKE '" + userName + "';", function(error, data) {
	//Code here executes after you query...
});
```


Another important difference, is that I used two-factor authentication in my version, but that is a feature I added much later, and I will get to explaining that portion later.

## 4.4 Sending emails and tokens
Turns out, by later, I mean I'll explain right now.

The email token validation part is the last feature I added.

The idea is that after the user 'signs up', an email with a link is sent to their inputted email. Before he/she can access their account, they must click on the email link to validate their account.

I did THREE major things for this.

**First** is, using my '/make-query' online, I query'd a new table called 'token', with columns for identifying the associated user, the token itself, and the expiry date (which is in [Unix Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)).

**Second**, to create the token, I used the bcrypt function in my 'loginquery.js', the same one used to encrypt passwords (Now that I think about it, maybe that's not very secure??? :S ).

**Third**, to send the email, I used a new node package, called 'nodemailer'.

```javascript
var nodeMailer = require('nodemailer'); //Import the module

//Sets up the mailing service (I created a new account for this)
var smtpTransport = nodeMailer.createTransport({
  service: "gmail", //hostname
  host: "smtp.gmail.com",
  auth: {
    user: "haodasdemo@gmail.com",
    pass: "godisdeadgodremainsdeadandwehavekilledhim" //I made that password specifically for that account and this program, so don't you go trying to access my bank account or something with it.
  }
})

//Here is the function for sending mail:
var mailConfig = {
	to : "target@email.com", //Whatever your target email is
	subject : "subject text",
	text : "whatever the content of your email is"
}
smtpTransport.sendMail(mailConfig, function(err, response) {
	if (err) {
		console.log(err)
	}
	else {
		//code here will execute after you sent the mail
	}
});

```

**NOTE:** If you don't want to send from haodasdemo@gmail.com, you can use a different email source by configuring the data in `nodeMailer.createTransport({ data ... })`.

## 4.5 Things I'm too dumb to figure out

The main thing I have yet to implement successfully is a way to **get rid of unvalidated users** and their **expired tokens**. If you look in the file 'loginquery.js', you'll find a pair of purge functions. Neither of these really function properly. If you are continuing to work on this project, and can solve the token problem, then that would be **awesome**.

## 4.6 Other areas of improvement

There are a few other things I would've liked to improve on my program.
1. My token authentication is not modularized like the rest of my code! The logic for the token verification and stuff is in **'routes.js'**, which is **really bad form**. Better form would be to make a new javascript file in '/models/' and import it to routes.
2. My program is blank and ugly! I did not spend much effort at all in the front end UI design.
3. Although passport is great and all, I think (correct me if I'm wrong) the IBM Cloud has its own service for authentication, which is much more secure than anything my naive lil brain can think up.
4. Embedded JavaScript (ejs) is an okay templating system for the front end views, but I kind of wish I used something a little fancier, like **React or Angular**. Perhaps that's something you could do?

# 5.0 Conclusion

*"The Die is Cast. The Rubicon has been crossed. Mother, you will either see me the next* Cloud Developer *Maximus, or go into exile."* From here until 4-8 months from now, there's no going back. But I believe in you, young co-op student. You will *veni, vidi, and then vici* every challenge you face at this workplace, and emerge as undisputed master of Rome, and by extension, the World.

Hopefully this document will ~~secure my legacy~~ help you with your job here.

If you have any questions at all about this document, about your job here, the program I made, or even if you just want to have a nice chat, you can **contact me**! In most jobs, you're supposed to work with a team and have a mentor, but if you're like me and working solo on a cloud project, you won't be getting that luxury. If need be, I can be your mentor... for a price. And that price is apparently nothing. So yeah just contact me I guess. :)

My email is 'haoda.fan@outlook.com'. You can also find me through linkedin (http://linkedin.com/in/haodafan), or you can just text me that's fine too (226 979 9881).

Thank you! GL HF!
